To evaluate the provided questions and solutions, I'll analyze each one according to the requirements laid out in your guidelines.

### Question 1 Analysis
**Question:** Demonstrate a class Employee that includes fields for employee's name, ID, salary, address, and date of birth.  
- **CLO:** CLO-2
- **Expected Bloom's Level:** Understanding/Applying (CLO-2 generally involves demonstrating knowledge).

**Analysis of the Question Taxonomy Level:**
- The question requires students to apply knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts to create a class, which corresponds to the Application level (C3) of Bloom's Taxonomy. 

**Comparison to Given Level:**
- The level is appropriately matched. 

**Rating:** 8/10  
**Key Elements:** Clear instructions, specific requirements, aligns with learning outcomes.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** Enhance clarity by specifying any specific methods/functions the class must or must not include.

### Solution 1 Analysis
**Solution Code:**
```java
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private int id;
    private double salary;
    private Address address;
    private Date dateOfBirth;
    // Constructors, getters, setters, and tokenizing methods...
}
```

**Bloom's Taxonomy Level Verification:**
- The solution demonstrates knowledge and application of object-oriented concepts, containing encapsulation, class structure, and methods.

**Rating:** 9/10  
**Key Elements:** Good implementation of class structure, encapsulation via private fields, implementation of methods as required.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs in the setters.

### Question 2 Analysis
**Question:** Identify exceptions and provide exception handling for given code snippets.  
- **CLO:** CLO-3

**Analysis of the Question Taxonomy Level:**

**Comparison to Given Level:**
- The level appears to be suitable as it requires critical thinking to fix existing issues.

**Rating:** 8/10  
**Key Elements:** Clear requirements to analyze and create, aligns with learning outcomes.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** Provide examples of common exceptions to help guide students.

### Solution 2 Analysis
**Solution Code:** Code snippets with appropriate exception handling.
- The solutions provide correctly structured exception handling with try-catch blocks for each provided code snippet.

**Bloom's Taxonomy Level Verification:**
- The solutions demonstrate critical analysis and application of programming principles.

**Rating:** 9/10  
**Key Elements:** Correct identification of exceptions, effective implementation of error handling.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** More detailed explanations alongside the code could improve clarity.

### Question 3 Analysis
**Question:** Design a GUI software editor for Java programs with specific features.  
- **CLO:** CLO-3

**Analysis of the Question Taxonomy Level:**
- This requires design and application of complex programming concepts, fitting into the Synthesis level (C5).

**Comparison to Given Level:**
- The specified CLO level is adequate as students are expected to integrate various components into a complete solution.

**Rating:** 10/10  
**Key Elements:** Multifaceted requirements, encourages creativity and technical skill.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** None, very well structured.

### Solution 3 Analysis
**Solution Code:** GUI editor implementation.
- The solution demonstrates the implementation of all required features using Java Swing, indicating a deep application of GUI programming concepts.

**Bloom's Taxonomy Level Verification:**
- This showcases not only knowledge but also application and synthesis of various programming principles.

**Rating:** 10/10  
**Key Elements:** Complete implementation addressing all requirements, user interface considerations, proper error handling is applied.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** None required; the solution is comprehensive.

### Summary of Evaluations
- **Question 1:** Level matched, Rating: 8.      
- **Solution 1:** Level verified, Rating: 9.   
- **Question 2:** Level matched, Rating: 8.     
- **Solution 2:** Level verified, Rating: 9.   
- **Question 3:** Level matched, Rating: 10.     
- **Solution 3:** Level verified, Rating: 10.

Overall, both the questions and solutions provided robust alignment with the expected Bloom's Taxonomy levels involving Analysis, Application, and Synthesis as indicated by the CLOs.
