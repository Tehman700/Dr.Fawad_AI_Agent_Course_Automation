### Question Analysis

#### Question:
**Infer a Java program using OOP concepts for the following scenario, we have concrete classes for real animals like Cow, Lion, Parrot, and Elephant. Each class implements the Animal interface, providing implementations for the eat(), sleep(), and makeSound() methods. These methods define the common behaviours of all animals. The Mammal and Bird abstract classes provide common properties and behaviours for mammals and birds, respectively. The main class Zoo demonstrates the usage of these classes by creating instances of different animals and invoking their behaviours.** (CLO-1, C2)

**Taxonomy Level Identified:** The question involves application-level tasks as the student is required to apply OOP concepts to create a Java program. Therefore, it aligns with Bloom's Taxonomy level 2 (C2).

**Comparison with Given Level:** The specified level is also C2, so they match.

- **Action:** No changes needed; the question is appropriately aligned with the expected taxonomy level.

---

### Solution Analysis

#### Solution:
1. **Interface and Abstract Classes**
   - Animal Interface: Declares the common behaviors for all animals.
   - Mammal and Bird Abstract Classes: Provide common properties and behaviors for mammals and birds, respectively.

2. **Concrete Classes**
   - Cow, Lion, Elephant: Implement the Mammal abstract class.
   - Parrot: Implements the Bird abstract class.

3. **Main Class**
   - Zoo: Demonstrates the usage of these classes by creating instances of different animals and invoking their behaviors.

**Java Code Implementation:**
```java
// Animal interface
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
    void makeSound();
}

// Mammal abstract class
abstract class Mammal implements Animal {
    protected String type = "Mammal";

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println(type + " is sleeping.");
    }
}

// Bird abstract class
abstract class Bird implements Animal {
    protected String type = "Bird";

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println(type + " is sleeping.");
    }
}

// Other classes follow...
```
*And then code for Cow, Lion, Elephant, and Parrot implement the methods accordingly.*

**Taxonomy Level Verification:** The solution requires the application of knowledge (C2) through the implementation of an actual Java program demonstrating object-oriented principles, and thus it properly meets the requirements of the specific taxonomy level.

- **Rating:** 10/10 - The solution fulfills the question's requirements entirely, accurately demonstrating the necessary OOP concepts.

- **Key Elements that meet requirements:**
  - Clear declaration of the Animal interface.
  - Proper implementation of abstract classes for Mammal and Bird.
  - Concrete class implementations that execute the expected behaviors.
  - A main class that effectively demonstrates how these classes can be utilized.

**Suggestions for Improvement:** None required as the solution fully meets the expected outcomes of the task.

# Quiz 2.docx

Let's evaluate the provided questions and their corresponding solutions according to the specified requirements.

### Question Analysis

1. **Question 1: Concatenating Strings**  
   Taxonomy Level: C3 (Application)
   - **Analysis of Taxonomy Level:** The question prompts students to apply knowledge of string manipulation by creating a program that concatenates two strings. 
   - **Evaluation:** The level matches the requirement.
  
2. **Question 2: Searching Substrings**  
   Taxonomy Level: C3 (Application)
   - **Analysis of Taxonomy Level:** Similar to question 1, this question requires the application of string manipulation techniques to determine if one string exists within another. 
   - **Evaluation:** The level matches the requirement.

3. **Question 3: Splitting Strings**  
   Taxonomy Level: C4 (Analysis)
   - **Analysis of Taxonomy Level:** This question asks students to analyze a sentence by splitting it into words, which is slightly higher in complexity than concatenation or searching. 
   - **Evaluation:** This level does not match the requirement which only mentioned C3 for Questions 1 and 2.

### Suggested Improvements for Question 3:
- **Improvement Guidance:** To align with the desired level of C3, you can modify the question to require a specific output analysis, such as counting the words or transforming the words in a particular way.
  
**Example Improvements:**
1. Write a program that prompts the user for a sentence, splits it into words, and then counts the number of words.
2. Modify the previous question to ask the user to split a sentence into words and print only those that start with a vowel.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Solution 1: Concatenating Strings**  
   - **Taxonomy Level:** C3
   - **Rating:** 10/10
   - **Key Elements:** Correctly uses string concatenation and user input.
   - **Suggestions for Improvement:** None needed as it meets the expected level.
  
2. **Solution 2: Searching Substrings**  
   - **Taxonomy Level:** C3
   - **Rating:** 10/10
   - **Key Elements:** Effectively uses string functions to check for substring presence.
   - **Suggestions for Improvement:** None required.
  
3. **Solution 3: Splitting Strings**  
   - **Taxonomy Level:** C4
   - **Rating:** 7/10
   - **Key Elements:** Splits the sentence into words but does not analyze or manipulate the results further per the intended complexity level.
   - **Suggestions for Improvement:** Enhance the solution to not only split the sentence but also count the number of words, or perhaps output only the words meeting certain criteria.

### Summary
- Questions 1 and 2 align perfectly with their C3 taxonomy level.
- Question 3 needs to be revised to align with the expected level. 
- Solutions 1 and 2 are effective and meet requirements, while Solution 3 requires enhancements to fully comply with the intended outcomes.

# Quiz 3.docx

### Question Analysis
**Question**: Create a Java program to input a paragraph from the user and count the words "The" and "is" ignoring the case and write the count in a file.  
**CLO**: CLO-3  
**Bloom's Taxonomy Level**: C5 (Evaluating)

1. **Identified Taxonomy Level**: The question is primarily a single-task programming requirement that falls under the applying or analyzing levels of Bloom's Taxonomy but leans more toward the applying level (C3). It involves using knowledge to perform a specific function but does not necessarily require evaluation or justification of the approach taken.

2. **Comparison**: 
   - **Given Level**: C5 (Evaluating)
   - **Identified Level**: C3 (Applying)

3. **Modification Suggestion**: 
   - To elevate this question to meet the desired taxonomy level (C5 Evaluating), it could process a requirement to not just implement counting, but to analyze or evaluate different methods of counting words and justify the chosen approach.
   
   **Improved Question Examples**:
   - *Example 1*: "Create a Java program to input a paragraph from the user and count the words 'The' and 'is', ignoring the case. Evaluate the efficiency of two different algorithms that could perform this task and justify the choice of the algorithm you implement."
   - *Example 2*: "Develop a Java program to analyze a given text and count the frequency of the words 'The' and 'is'. Evaluate the overall effectiveness of the approach taken and suggest improvements or alternative methods."

---

### Solution Analysis
**Solution**:  
The provided Java code counts the words "the" and "is" in a paragraph provided by the user and writes the results to a text file.

1. **Taxonomy Level Verification**: The solution effectively implements the counting functionality, aligning with the original question's requirements. However, it does not analyze or evaluate different methods, which is necessary to meet the C5 level.

2. **Rating and Key Elements**:
   - **Rating**: 6/10
   - **Key Elements**:
     - The solution correctly reads input from the user.
     - It counts occurrences of the specified words.
     - It efficiently writes the output to a file.

3. **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
   - To meet the C5 evaluating level:
     - Include a comparison between different counting methods (e.g., using regular expressions vs. string methods).
     - Discuss the time complexity of each method used.
     - Provide an explanation of why one method might be preferred over another for this task.
   
   **Enhancement Areas**:
   - Code comments could be added to clarify each step.
   - Implement an analysis section in the solution that examines potential improvements for handling larger texts, such as using data structures that allow for faster lookups.

By addressing these issues, the solution will better align with the expected outcomes of Bloom's Taxonomy C5 level.
